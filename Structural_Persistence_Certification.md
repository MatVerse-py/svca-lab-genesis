# Structural Persistence Certification

**MatVerse Node**

**Authors**: Mateus Arêas [1], Manus AI  
**Date**: February 17, 2026  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Status**: Certified / Executable Artifact

## Executive Statement

The MatVerse artifact has reached a state of structural anchoring in which its identity, scholarly addressability, cryptographic commitment, and empirical references are publicly verifiable.

Rather than asserting permanence, this report demonstrates that the architectural conditions required for long-term persistence have been established.

The system now transitions from active construction into temporal validation.

## Section I — Anchoring Conditions

This section evaluates whether the MatVerse artifact has established the structural conditions required for long-horizon interpretability.

**Criteria:**

- **Genesis recorded**: The initial state of the MatVerse artifact, representing its origin, has been immutably recorded.
- **Ontological hash generated**: A unique, cryptographically secure hash (Ohash) has been generated for the artifact, binding its digital representation to its physical and logical structure.
- **DOI active**: A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) has been assigned and is active, providing a persistent and resolvable link to the artifact's scientific publication.
- **Public dataset linked**: The underlying dataset and code are publicly accessible and linked through platforms like Hugging Face, ensuring data availability and transparency.
- **Repository stabilized**: The version-controlled repository (GitHub) is stable, publicly accessible, and reflects the current state of the artifact.
- **Scholarly identity bound**: The authorship is clearly linked to a verifiable scholarly identity (ORCID), ensuring proper attribution and academic traceability.

**Conclusion:**

The artifact satisfies the preconditions for structural persistence.

## Section II — Identity Stability

The artifact maintains continuity through:

- **Explicit lineage**: A clear and verifiable chain of states (Ψ-State) exists, tracing the evolution of the artifact from its genesis.
- **Sealed historical reference**: Each state references its predecessor via cryptographic hashes, making the history immutable and resistant to retroactive falsification.
- **Public identifiers**: Key identifiers (Ohash, PUF ID, DOI) are publicly available and verifiable, reducing ambiguity and facilitating independent validation.

These elements reduce interpretive drift across time.

## Section III — Epistemic Independence

The artifact can increasingly be interpreted without reliance on its creator.

This property marks the threshold between project and reference object.

## Section IV — Temporal Risk Disclosure

Long-horizon artifacts face predictable risks:

- **Cryptographic aging**: The potential for cryptographic algorithms to become vulnerable over time due to advances in computational power or cryptanalysis.
- **Repository degradation**: The risk of data loss or corruption in storage systems, or the obsolescence of repository platforms.
- **Technological obsolescence**: The possibility that underlying technologies or programming languages may become outdated, making the artifact difficult to run or interpret.
- **Institutional discontinuity**: The risk of changes in organizational support, funding, or policies that could impact the long-term maintenance and accessibility of the artifact.

The MatVerse architecture mitigates these risks through transparency, lineage, and structural verifiability.

## Certification Statement

The MatVerse does not claim permanence.
It establishes the structural conditions under which persistence may emerge.
